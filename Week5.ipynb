    "The academic office at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has compiled data about students' grades.

Each part has a specific line format, described below..\n",

    "The possible grades are A, AB, B, BC, C, CD, D with corresponding grade points 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4. The grade point average of a student is the sum of his/her grade points divided by the number of courses. For instance, if a student has taken two courses with grades A and C, the grade point average is 8.50 = (10+7)รท2. If a student has not completed any courses, the grade point average is defined to be 0.\n",

The third section begins with a line containing Grades. The end of the input is marked by a line containing EndOfInput.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your output should be sorted by Roll Number. The grade point average should be rounded off to 2 digits after the decimal point. Use the built-in function round()."
